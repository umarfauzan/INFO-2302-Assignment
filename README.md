# INFO-2302-Assignment

For the javascript interaction portion of the assignment, I made a pop up form when the user click on the 'Sign Up' button.

This is the javascript coding for the pop up function:

        **let popup = document.getElementById("popup");

        function openPopup() {
            popup.classList.add("open-popup");
        }

        function closePopup() {
            popup.classList.remove("open-popup");
        }**
        
*I've also put the javascript coding in the same file as HTML because I could not manage to get it to work by doing it in a seperate file.
